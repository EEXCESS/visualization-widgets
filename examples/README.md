# Examples

This folder provides examples of all available visualization widgets in action and shows how to include them (have a look in the code in `index.html`). 
For a live version, see this **[demo](http://rawgit.com/EEXCESS/visualization-widgets/master/examples/index.html)** page.

Several libraries/components are used in this example, in particular:
* jquery
* requirejs
* [EEXCESS c4](https://github.com/EEXCESS/c4)
* All visualizations currently available in this repository

These libraries are only added to the example and not modified in any way. The only file which contains custom code is `index.html`. See the comments in this file for instructions on how to use visualization widgets.
## Recommendation Dashboard Example

The file `index-dashboard.html` gives you an example, how to use the Recommendation Dashboard Visualisations. 
**NOTE:** One of the Dashboard Visualisations, uRank, is referenced as a GIT submodule. If you would like to view the Dasboard, you also have to clone/update the submodule in Dashboard/uRank
