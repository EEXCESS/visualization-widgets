# Search result list and search interface example

This example shows the usage of the SearchResultList widget together with a simple search interface. Several libraries/components are used in this example, in particular:
* jquery
* requirejs
* [EEXCESS c4](https://github.com/EEXCESS/c4)
* SearchResultList from [visualization-widgets](https://github.com/EEXCESS/visualization-widgets) repository

These libraries are only added to the example and not modified in any way. The only file which contains custom code is `index.html`. See the comments in this file for instructions on how to create a search interface and how to use visualization widgets. This example shows the use of SearchResultList, but the approach is the same for all visualization widgets.
